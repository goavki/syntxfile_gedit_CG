# syntxfile_gedit_CG
This syntax file should help you working/looking at Constraint Grammar files from Apertium with gedit.
To use this syntax file you need to add lrx.lang to the directory ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs 
You can do that with the following command:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuboro/syntxfile_gedit_CG/master/rlx.lang -O ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/rlx.lang

Now you can start using the syntax file either if you choose "CG" or automatically if the file ends with .rlx
